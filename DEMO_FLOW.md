## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Chat not syncing?
- Make sure both tabs are on the same domain (localhost:3000)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing both tabs

### Messages not persisting?
- Check browser localStorage (DevTools → Application → Local Storage)
- Look for keys starting with `ns_chat_`

### Feature flag not working?
- Make sure `.env.local` exists (not just `.env.example`)
- Restart dev server after changing env variables
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CHAT=false` is set correctly

## 📝 Notes for Demo

- **All data is mocked:** No database required
- **localStorage persistence:** Data survives page refreshes
- **Two-tab requirement:** Chat demo needs two browser tabs
- **User switching:** Use dropdown in chat header to switch users
- **Deterministic IDs:** Conversation IDs are deterministic (same users = same conversation)
